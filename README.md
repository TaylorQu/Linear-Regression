# Linear-Regression

This file introduces a step-by-step approach to solving linear regression problems. We will learn to build a model in python. The goal of this model is to predict the profits of new restaurants based on the population size of a city.
This file summaries the foundational elements of machine learning, particularly supervised learning, where the task is to map learning from inputs (urban population) to outputs (profits) according to example input-output pairs. It emphasizes the importance of understanding data, mathematical modeling problems, and performance-based quantitative measures (cost functions) to iteratively improve models
