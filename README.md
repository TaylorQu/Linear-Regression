# Linear-Regression
Nowadays, AI technology develops rapidly and has been applied to many fields. And the machine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models
This file is the first step into machine learning. And it introduces an approach to solving the first question(linear regression problems). In this process,  We will learn to build a model in python. The goal of this model is to predict the profits of new restaurants based on the population size of a city.
This file summaries the foundational elements of machine learning, particularly supervised learning, where the task is to map learning from inputs (urban population) to outputs (profits) according to example input-output pairs. It emphasizes the importance of understanding data, mathematical modeling problems, and performance-based quantitative measures (cost functions) to iteratively improve models.
